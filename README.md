# Graph Neural Networks and Their Applications

## Project Description

This project focuses on graph neural networks, what they are and how they work. It also focuses on applications of GNNs and how we can use them to solve various problems. This project consists of two Jupyter notebooks. The first serves as an introduction to GNNs and related concepts, and the second is a particular application of them that involves predicting the topics of a student's notes. This project was for the COSC 3P99 course.

### Technologies Used

- Python / Google Colaboratory (Jupyter Notebook)
- PyTorch / PyTorch Geometric

### Blog Inspiration

Part of this project was inspired by a [Medium article](https://medium.com/stanford-cs224w/augmenting-your-notes-using-graph-neural-networks-e61f0898033a) titled "Augmenting Your Notes Using Graph Neural Networks". The authors of this article trained a GNN model to predict the top three Wikipedia articles relating to a student's notes. The goal is to try to implement a similar model.

## Installation and How to Use

To get the notebook files, simply download them from the repo or clone the reop to your computer. To run the notebooks, you can use Google Colaboratory or another Jupyter Notebook service. If the code in the notebooks isn't working, be sure that you have run the `pip install` and library import code blocks.

To get the most out of this project, it is recommended to have some basic understanding of neural networks in general and PyTorch.
